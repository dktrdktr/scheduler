# Interview Scheduler

- Single page application (SPA) called Interview Scheduler, built using React.
- A user can switch between weekdays and book, cancel or edit interviews.
- The list of days informs the user how many slots are available for each day.
- Supplementary [Interview Scheduler Dashboard](https://github.com/dktrdktr/scheduler-dashboard) was created using React class-based components.
